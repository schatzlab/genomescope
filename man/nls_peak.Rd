\item{k}{An integer corresponding to the kmer length.}

\item{p}{An integer corresponding to the ploidy.}

\item{top}{An integer corresponding to the topology.}

\item{estKmercov}{A numeric corresponding to the estimated average kmer coverage of the polyploid genome.}

\item{estLength}{A numeric corresponding to the estimated polyploid genome length.}

\item{max_iterations}{An integer corresponding to the maximum number iterations to use for nlsLM.}
