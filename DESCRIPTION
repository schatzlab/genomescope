Description: GenomeScope analyzes the k-mer histogram to output estimates for genome size, heterozygosity, and repetitiveness, without requiring a reference genome. GenomeScope employs a polyploid-aware mixture model that, within seconds, accurately infers genome properties from unassembled sequencing data. GenomeScope produces a report and several informative plots describing the genome properties.
